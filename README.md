### Hi! 👋

I'm currently working at RBC as a Software Developer Intern!

---

Over the past few years I've had the chance to meet amazing people at Google and Deloitte Canada doing frontend development. 

I'm passionate about the intersection of **design and code**, if I'm not coding you'll likely find me on Figma 📐 or recording music 🎵! 

Check out my [favorites](https://omarflores.dev/favorites) page for some tools that have helped me throughout my journey.

Fun fact: I've previously sung with a Grammy nominated choral ensemble 🎼.
