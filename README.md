### Hi! 👋

I'm currently working at Google as a SWE intern and building an OpenAPI spec tool for the [Apigee](https://cloud.google.com/apigee) platform!

Over the past few years I've had the chance to meet amazing people at Deloitte Canada and RBC doing frontend development. 

I'm passionate about the intersection of **design and code**, if I'm not coding you'll likely find me on Figma 📐 or recording music 🎵! 

Check out my [favorites](https://omarflores.dev/favorites) page for some tools that have helped me throughout my journey.

Fun fact: I **love** Borzoi dogs and I've previously sung with a Grammy nominated choral ensemble 🎼.
