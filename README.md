### Hi! 👋

I'm currently interning at Google as a SWE intern doing cool stuff with the Apigee platform!

---

Over the past few years I've had the chance to meet amazing people at Deloitte Canada and RBC doing frontend development. 

I'm passionate about the intersection of **design and code**, if I'm not coding you'll likely find me on Figma 📐 or recording music 🎵! 

Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding Computer Science or for any career advice ✨.

Fun fact: I **love** Borzoi dogs and I've previously sung with a Grammy nominated choral ensemble 🎼.
